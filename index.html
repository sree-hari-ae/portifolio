        <h2>About</h2>
        <p1>I am Sreehari A.E., a second-year student
             currently pursuing an Integrated Master's
              program in Computational Science.
               My academic journey is deeply rooted in
                understanding complex computational
                 systems, and I am particularly drawn to 
                 the dynamic field of web development. My 
                 passion lies in crafting efficient and 
                 intuitive digital experiences through
                 code. This personal website serves as
                  a platform to showcase my projects,
                  share my learning journey, and connect
                   with fellow enthusiasts in the world 
                   of technology. I am constantly 
                   exploring new technologies and concept
                    within web development, eager to apply
                     theoretical knowledge to practical, 
                     innovative solutions.
